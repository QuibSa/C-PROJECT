# Welcome to the Cash Flow Optimization System designed specifically for banks.
This software aims to streamline and enhance the cash flow management processes within your banking institution. Before you proceed,please take a moment to review this Read Me file .


***Features***
1. Real-time Cash Flow Monitoring:
Monitor the cash flow status of the bank in real-time.
Gain insights into inflows and outflows across various accounts.
2. Expense Tracking and Management:
Efficiently track and manage operational expenses.
Categorize expenses to identify areas for cost optimization.


Problem Statement
Consider a network of banks involved in financial transactions. Each bank has a set of supported payment modes, and payments can only be made or received through these modes. The goal is to minimize the overall cash flow between banks by settling debts in an optimal manner.

Banks and Supported Payment Modes
Bank_of_America: Google_Pay, AliPay, Paytm
Wells_Fargo: Google_Pay, AliPay
Royal_Bank_of_Canada: AliPay
Westpac: Google_Pay, Paytm
Goldman_Sachs: Paytm
National_Australia_Bank: AliPay, Paytm


Net Amount Calculation:

Calculate the net amount for each bank using the formula:
net amount = Sum of all credits - Sum of all debits


Settlement Process:

While there are unsettled banks:
Identify the bank with the maximum debtor amount (X) and the bank with the maximum creditor amount (Y) that shares a common payment mode (M1).
Determine the settlement amount (Z) as the minimum of the absolute values of X and Y.
Process the settlement:
If |X| < Y, X is settled and removed from the list.
If |X| > Y, Y is settled and removed from the list.
If |X| = Y, both X and Y are settled and removed from the list.
Update the net amounts for the remaining banks.
Repeat:

Repeat the settlement process until no further settlements are possible.
Example
For the provided example, the algorithm would iteratively settle transactions as described, ultimately minimizing the overall cash flow between banks.

Optimal Transactions
This algorithm ensures efficient cash flow management among banks, settling debts with a minimal number of transactions.

Feel free to customize this algorithm to fit the specific requirements of your system or application.
